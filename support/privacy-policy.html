				business. We may transfer information we have collected and stored,
				including personal information, to the party or parties involved in the
				transaction or as part of that transaction.

				child's parent or guardian has been secured in advance.
			</p>
			<p>What Personal Information Does McDonald's Collect?</p>
			<p>
				We may collect personal information, such as name, postal address, email
				address, phone number and date of birth from children (not year) as part
				of an activity. For example:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We may collect a child's email address to notify the child if he or
					she has won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstakes.
					In this event, we will notify the child using the email address the
					child supplies. We will not keep the email address or use it for any
					other purpose.
				</li>
				<li>
					We may collect a child's email address in order to respond to a
					request from the child on a one-time basis, such as to send the child
					a screen saver. In this case, we promptly delete the email address
					from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the address
					for any other purpose.
				</li>
				<li>
					We collect a child's name, postal address, email address, phone number

				use the child's name, postal address, email address, phone number and
				date of birth to process a child's online order. In case we collect the

				judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities, or
				when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent
				physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation
				of suspected or actual illegal activity.

				vendors that perform services for McDonald's. These services may include
				hosting our Sites, providing technical services to McDonald's,
				fulfilling requests or administering a contest, competition, prize draw,

			<p>
				McDonald's uses cookies and other similar technologies to collect

				“How We Use the Information We Collect.”
			</p>
			<p>
				We also use these technologies to collect information about your online
				activities over time and across third-party websites or other online
				services (behavioral tracking). The technologies we use for this
				automatic data collection may include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Cookies (or browser cookies). Cookies are small text files that are
					stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit
					a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on
					each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that
					cookie, and allow a website to recognize a user’s device.
				</li>
				<p>We currently use the following types of cookies:</p>
				<li>
					Cookies that are strictly necessary: These are cookies that are
					required for the operation of our Website. These include, for example,
					cookies that enable a user to log into the members’ area of our
					Website and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular
					service or content.
				</li>
				<li>
					Analytical cookies: These cookies allow us to recognize and count the
					number of users and to see how users use and explore our Website.
					These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring
					that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily.
				</li>
				<li>
					Functionality cookies: We are always glad to see you back. These types
					of cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to our Website in
					order to greet you by name and to remember, for example, your choice
					of language.
				</li>
				<li>
					Targeting cookies: These cookies record the visit of a user on our
					Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has
					followed in order to enable us to make our Website more relevant to
					the users’ interests. In addition, these cookies are used to identify
					the websites and the marketing materials you are accessing our Website
					from in order to target content (for example, to automatically show
					you our Website according to your language settings).
				</li>
				<li>
					We do not require that you accept cookies and you may withdraw your
					consent to our use of cookies at any time by adjusting your browser’s
					privacy settings. However, if you decline to accept cookies, some
					functions on our Website may be disabled and you may be unable to
					access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your
					browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue
					cookies when you use your browser to access our Website. Cookies can
					be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie
					expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie
					will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration
					dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few
					minutes while others may expire after several years.
				</li>
				<li>
					Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Website may use local stored
					objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your
					preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies
					are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser
					cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security
					settings for Flash cookies, see “Choices About How We Collect, Use and
					Disclose Your Personal Information”.
				</li>
				<li>
					Web Beacons. Our Website pages and our e-mails may contain small
					electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel
					tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that are tiny graphics with a
					unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to
					track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike
					cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web
					beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email) and
					are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web
					beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count
					users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to
					understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics
					(for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and
					verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an
					anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online
					advertisement displayed on a third-party website.
				</li>
				<li>
					Device identifiers. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or
					phone to access our Website, we may access, collect, monitor, store on
					your device, or remotely store one or more “device identifiers”.
					Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures
					stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely
					identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in
					connection with the device’s hardware, data stored in connection with
					the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the
					device by the Website. A device identifier may deliver information to
					us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the
					Website and may help others or us to provide reports or personalized
					content and advertisements. Some features of the Website may not
					function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is
					impaired or disabled.
				</li>
			</ul>

				Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a
				cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive
				a cookie. Click on the “Help” section of your browser to learn how to
				change your cookie preferences. If you disable all cookies, you may not
				be able to take advantage of all the features of this Site.
			</p>
			<p>Other Technologies</p>
			<p>
				We may use other technologies, including web beacons and JavaScript,
				which sometimes work together with cookies and other means with our
				Sites and Mobile Apps to uniquely identify your device. These other
				technologies help enable features on our Sites and within our Mobile
				Apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may also use certain technologies to determine whether you have
				opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Where video is available on our Online Services, we may target and
					track the videos you view. You consent to our tracking of your video
					viewing through Online Services or third-party social media for up to

			<p>Targeted Advertising</p>
			<p>
				On our Online Services, we may collect information about your online
				activities for use in providing you with advertising tailored to your
				individual interests, provided you have opted-in to marketing
				communications. This section of our Privacy Statement provides details
				and explains how to manage your choices.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may see certain advertisements on other websites because we
				participate in advertising networks. Advertising networks allow us to
				target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and
				contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time
				by collecting information through automated means, including through the
				use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other technologies. The
				networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be
				tailored to your individual interests. The information our advertising
				networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites
				that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages
				or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.
				This data collection takes place both on our Online Services and on
				third-party websites that participate in the advertising networks. This
				process also helps us evaluate our marketing efforts.
			</p>
			<p>Links to Other Websites and Social Media</p>
			<p>
				Our Online Services may offer links to third-party websites that are not
				operated by McDonald's. If you visit one of these linked websites, you
				should review the website's privacy policy, terms and conditions, and
				other policies. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of
				third-parties. Any information you submit to these third-parties is
