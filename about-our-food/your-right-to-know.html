				<h4>Philip</h4>

				<div class="question">
					Do any of your products contain nuts? Dear Anna, we are aware of the
					serious health risk to people who are allergic to whole peanuts, nuts
					or nut derivatives and these are excluded as ingredients from our menu
					items. However, we are unable to categorically state that our products
					are 100% free of nuts or nut derivatives, because there is a
					possibility of cross contamination at some point in the food chain or
					even in our restaurants. In the event that a promotional product
					contains peanuts, nuts, or nuts derivatives, this will be clearly
					labelled on the restaurants allergen information. Aside from that we
					provide ingredient and allergen information on our websites.
